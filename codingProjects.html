                        <h3>War Game</h3>
                        <p>This is a game similar to War, where each player draws a card and the player with the higher card value keeps both cards, and wins when they collect 52 cards. 
                            The player can enter their own name of choice. There are counters for how many cards each player has in the lower left and right corners of the window. 
                            The "continue" button draws cards for both players.</p>

                        <h3>Animal Matching Game</h3>
                        <p>The window shows 4 different pairs of animals in a random order. When an animal is clicked once, it turns invisible, and if a correct match is made, then both animals disappear.
                            However, if an incorrect match is made, the original animal will become visible again. A timer and clock are both on the bottom of the screen.

                        <p>
                            The window displays several windows form tools. Filling out these tools and hitting the submit button creates different output depending on what you enter.
